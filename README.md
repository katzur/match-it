# About the project
MATCH IT is a fun, simple memory game website. The game itself allows the user to test their memory in short (under 2 min) rounds of pairing cards challenge. By the default the game is dedicated mostly to younger users, due to the illustrative, cheerful style of the game, and possibility to learn about the geometric shapes and colors while playing, although more mature users will find it enteratining as well, due to the timed, competitive nature of the game. 
The idea behind the game is to memorize the cards position on the board, and pair them as fast as possible, before the time runs out. Users can practice by reattempting the game, and try to improve their memory skills to beat their previous time scores, as well as learn about the geometric shapes and colors.
